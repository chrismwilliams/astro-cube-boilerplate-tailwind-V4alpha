# Astro CUBE CSS Boilerplate testing Tailwind CSS v4.0 alpha

Fork of [Astro CUBE Boilerplate](https://github.com/frankstallone/astro-cube-boilerplate).

## TODO:

- [x] Replace all tokens, now added in `./src/css/variables/*`.
- [ ] Add utilities, inc: region-space, flow-space, and gutter. `tailwind.config.mjs` doesn't do anything at this time.

Tailwind is currently setting a `base` default.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
